network model has been trained and evaluated on both training and validation datasets. The training loss decreases as epochs increase, indicating successful learning from the training data. However, the validation loss fluctuates and does not show consistent improvement, leading to early stopping after the third epoch. The best model with the lowest validation loss was saved to the specified model directory. The model's F1 score is high, indicating excellent overall performance on the training set. However, the F1 score on the validation set is lower than on the training set, suggesting that the model might be overfitting to the training data and not generalizing well to unseen data. The confusion matrix shows few misclassifications, with false positives and false negatives in both classes, suggesting the model struggles to generalize well to the validation data.**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uSV_Bq1tOSS7"},"source":["**The model can now be used for making predictions on new, unseen data**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The below code is for testing purpose only.
